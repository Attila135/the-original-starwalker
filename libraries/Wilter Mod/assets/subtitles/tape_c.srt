<W>: I-it’s all blurring together.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,460
<W>: It- It’s been… ssso long, too long.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,460
<W>: I’ve been so alone.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,340
<W>: I feel like I’ve been’s hearing things…

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,680
<W>: The mirrors’s are talking to me, the walls.

8

<W>: Everything.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,080
<W>: I feel’s like I’ve been’s seeing faces.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,160

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,060
<W>: I DON'T EVEN WANNA SAY HIS NAME!

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,440
<W>: I… I still don’t understand why he DID THAT!

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,420
<W>: surely what I did’s wasn’t THAT bad in his eyes! ...right?

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,160
<W>: Gosh I, I miss Kris.

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,000
<W>: Being able to entertain them’s,

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,000
<W>: put a smile on their face…

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,080
<W>: What went’s wrong?

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,300
<W>: I feel like I always say something about’s that in every one of these. 

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,540
<W>: I just... I just wish’s I wasn’t so alone’s!

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,540

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,540
<W>: back’s to the good old’s days.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,320
<W>: …What’s the point’s in even making these?

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,460
<W>: Nobody’s gonna find them's!

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,260
<W>: NOBODY will come! not here… not ever.
